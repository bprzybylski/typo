# New Academic Wordpress Theme

This is a simple WordPress theme I made and use as my academic homepage at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. Feel free to download, test and modify it (you may just download the whole repositiory and put it into `wp-content/themes` folder of your WordPress installation). If you notice any problems, let me know, I will try to fix them.

Please note that this theme is not yet finished. To be honest, there is much left to do until it could be published in the official WordPress repository. However, it is already usable. You may see a live demo [here](https://bap.faculty.wmi.amu.edu.pl).
